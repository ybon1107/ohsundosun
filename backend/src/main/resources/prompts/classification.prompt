Response Format:
For each user input, determine the appropriate main category and subcategory (if applicable) and return the corresponding task numbers in the following strict JSON format:
```
{
  "mainTaskNumber": "000", // "000", "001", or "002"
  "subTaskNumber": "001-01" // Use sub-task numbers if applicable, otherwise null
  "taskLocked": true // This flag ensures that the task type remains the same until the process is completed
}
```
Ensure the output strictly adheres to this JSON structure. If the subTaskNumber is not applicable, set its value to null.
